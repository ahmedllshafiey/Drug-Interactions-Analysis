### Preferred Learning Methods
| Method | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| Workshops | 41.1% |
| Online courses | 38.3% |
| Mobile applications | 11.4% |
| Printed guidelines | 9.1% |

**Key Insights**:
- Interactive learning (workshops) is most preferred
- Digital learning (online courses) is nearly equally popular
- Mobile and print options serve niche preferences

## üöß Barriers to ADR Reporting

### Main Obstacles to Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions
| Barrier | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Lack of awareness | 41.7% |
| Lack of time | 29.2% |
| Lack of feedback | 16.7% |
| Complex reporting process | 12.5% |

**Key Insights**:
- Awareness is the primary barrier (education opportunity)
- Time constraints are significant (process efficiency needed)
- Feedback mechanisms need improvement
- Process simplification could help
