# Drug Interaction Visualization

This project contains a collection of data visualizations created as part of a scientific research study on drug interactions. The visualizations are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverage libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.

## Project Description

The notebook presents clear and focused plots that illustrate key findings from a survey conducted among healthcare professionals. The visualizations cover topics such as:

- Profession distribution among respondents
- Self-rated knowledge levels regarding drug interactions
- Primary sources of information about drug interactions
- Use of software for drug interaction checks
- Documentation practices for harmful drug interactions
- Need for further training on drug interactions
- Preferred learning tools and main barriers to adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting

These visuals are an integral part of a scientific research project aimed at understanding and improving awareness, knowledge, and practices related to drug interactions in clinical settings.

## How to Use

1. Open `Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the notebook cells to generate and view the visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas

Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
```
